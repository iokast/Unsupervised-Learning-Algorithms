-Reports:
-1) bwetzel6-analysis.pdf - Assignment 3 report
-
-Code Files: 
-1) parse.py - code to parse raw data files for this project
-2) helpers.py - Miscellaneous helper functions
-3) main.py - contains bulk of code implemented (dimensionality reduction, clustering, NN implementation)
-4) time.py - time experiments for clustering and neural networks
-
-There are also a number of folders
-1) P1_Clustering_Algorithms_Original - Output folder for clustering of the original dataset
-2) P2_Dimensionality_Reduction - Output folder for dimensionality reduction experiments
-3) P3_Clustering_Algorithms_Reduced - Output folder for clustering of dimensionally reduced datasets
-4) P4_Neural_Networks_Reduced - Output folder for NN results run with dimensionally reduced datasets
-5) P5_Neural_Networks_Reduced_With_Clusters - Output folder for NN results run with dimensionally reduced datasets with added cluster features
-6) Data Compilation - Contains excel files containing data and plots used in report
-
-Additional Files
-1) segmentation.csv - original Madelon data from the UCI ML repository
-2) bwetzel6-analysis.pdf - Assignment 3 report
-3) README.txt - this readme file
-
-To run the experiments:
-1) Run parse.py to generate the data files from the original data
-2) Run main.py and time.py
-
-The assignment code is written in Python 3.6.3. Library dependencies are: 
-numpy: 1.13.3
-pandas: 0.20.3
